# Next.js 13.2 + React Query

## Getting started

After cloning the repository, install the dependencies and
launch the dev server.

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

`/todos/server` fetches todos from the server with the `use()` hook

`/todos/client` fetches todos from the client with `react-query#useQuery()`
